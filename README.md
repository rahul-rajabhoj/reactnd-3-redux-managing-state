# reactnd-3-redux-managing-state

We bolstered our application to handle a number of different actions as well as an entirely new piece of state! In addition to our app handling the ADD_TODO action, it now handles:

the REMOVE_TODO action
the TOGGLE_TODO action
We also created the goals reducer which handles:

an ADD_GOAL action
a REMOVE_GOAL action
So our application can now manage the state of our todos and goals, and it can do all of this, predictably!
