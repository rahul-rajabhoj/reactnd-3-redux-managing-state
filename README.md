# reactnd-3-redux-managing-state

In this section, we connected our functioning state application with a front-end UI. We added some form fields and buttons to our UI that can be used to add new Todo items and Goal items to the state. Updating the state will also cause the entire application to re-render so that the visual representation of the application matches that of the info stored in the state object.
